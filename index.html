     <p>Swimming is a great workout because you need to move your whole body against the resistance of the water.

        Swimming is a good all-round activity because it:
        keeps your heart rate up but takes some of the impact stress off your body
        builds endurance, muscle strength and cardiovascular fitness
        helps maintain a healthy weight, healthy heart and lungs
        tones muscles and builds strength
        provides an all-over body workout, as nearly all of your muscles are used during swimming. </p>
